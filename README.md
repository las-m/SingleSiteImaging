# SingleSiteImaging
 
All code relating to simulating, and processing imaging data should be placed in this repo.

Plan is to include three main modules:
 1. sisisim - Used to simulate images.
 2. sisitrain - Used to train machine learning algorithms based on simulated or experimental data.
 3. sisirecon - Reconstruction of on-site occupation from given image - either ML or algorithm-based approach.
